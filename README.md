# Account Management System | C++

Developed a C++ based Account Management System supporting Savings,
Checking, and Trust accounts using abstraction and runtime polymorphism
via an abstract Account class and I_Printable interface. 
Managed heterogeneous account objects using std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Account>> 
and implemented file handling for persistent storage of records.

Technical Skills Demonstrated:
OOP Design, Abstraction, Inheritance, Runtime Polymorphism, Interfaces,
STL (std::vector, Smart Pointers), File Handling (fstream)
